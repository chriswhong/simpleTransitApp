# simpleTransitApp
A simple transit app that takes a stop number and shows arrival times in Baltimore

This is a companion to some [civic hacking efforts](https://github.com/chriswhong/mtaMarylandBusTracking) going on around consuming and sharing real-time bus data.

Design template by James Schaffer is here: [https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/BG2AUSVAS#/screens](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/BG2AUSVAS#/screens)
